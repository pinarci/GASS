📜 README — General AI Safety Systems
📌 Overview
General AI Safety Systems (GASS) is a safety-oriented AI control and routing project designed to ensure the secure, ethical, and efficient operation of AI agents in real-time environments.
The system focuses on route decision-making, safety monitoring, and policy enforcement, providing a modular and extensible architecture that can adapt to various AI safety requirements.

This was developed as a senior capstone project with the aim of demonstrating both practical AI safety mechanisms and scalable software design principles.

🎯 Objectives
Prevent Harmful AI Actions: Monitor AI outputs and decisions to ensure they comply with safety guidelines.

Dynamic Routing & Control: Implement a routing system that can manage AI requests and redirect them through safety filters.

Real-Time Policy Enforcement: Stop or modify potentially dangerous AI behavior instantly.

Scalable Design: Architect the system so it can integrate with different AI models, APIs, and data sources.

🛠 System Architecture
1. Core Components
Component	Description
Routing Module	The heart of the system. Handles incoming AI requests, applies safety rules, and routes them to the correct processing path.
Safety Filters	A set of predefined and customizable rules to block, modify, or approve AI responses.
Policy Manager	Stores and enforces AI operational policies based on ethical guidelines, compliance rules, and user preferences.
Logging & Auditing	Keeps a detailed history of all interactions for transparency and debugging.

2. High-Level Flow
Request Intake: The system receives a query from the user/application.

Safety Screening: The query is checked against safety policies (e.g., no harmful instructions, no personal data leaks).

Decision Routing:

Safe: Forward to AI model for processing.

Unsafe: Modify, block, or reroute for review.

Response Processing: AI output is again screened before returning to the user.

Audit Logging: All actions are recorded for accountability.

⚙️ Implementation Details
Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python

Architecture Pattern: Modular / Service-Oriented

Core Features:

Dynamic safety rule matching

Configurable routing logic

Real-time monitoring

Routing Implementation
The routing logic was implemented from scratch to ensure full control over how queries are processed.
Key considerations:

Low Latency: Fast decision-making to avoid bottlenecks.

Custom Filters: Developers can add/remove safety rules without altering the core system.

Fail-Safe Defaults: In uncertain cases, the system errs on the side of caution.

🔍 Example Use Case
Imagine an AI-powered assistant integrated into a corporate network:

A user asks the AI to access sensitive internal documents.

The Policy Manager detects that the request violates confidentiality rules.

The Routing Module blocks the request and logs the attempt.

The AI responds with a safe alternative or a refusal message.

🧪 Testing & Validation
We tested the system in scenarios involving:

Malicious queries (e.g., harmful instructions)

Sensitive data requests

Normal safe usage

Detection Accuracy

False Positive/Negative Rates

System Latency

📈 Future Improvements
Machine Learning-based Safety Detection instead of purely rule-based filtering.

Multi-AI Model Support for routing across different LLMs.

Web-based Dashboard for live monitoring and rule management.

Integration with Cloud Services (AWS, GCP, Azure).
